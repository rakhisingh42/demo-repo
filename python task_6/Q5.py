'''You are developing a program that analyzes weather data. Write a Python function that takes a list of temperature readings for a specific location and determines the average temperature, highest temperature, and lowest temperature.
Input
temperature_readings = [25, 28, 21, 24, 27]
Output:
Average Temperature: 25.0
Highest Temperature: 28
Lowest Temperature: 21
